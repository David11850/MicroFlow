1.what is the progress?--------we successfully run this engine in resperryPi4 using docker and stand_test and self-trained-model-weights
                                ,which is not so precious.
2.How to run this project in Pi4?------we have saved the docker image,stand_test,and weights file in the SD cards,which can be inserted 
                                        into the Pi,or maybe we should change the original device to Pi4,so we can save much of time to 
                                        adjust the par to fit for sepcific device.And when we enter the card system,here is the bash command
                                        to run the project

                                        cd/home/michael/code
                                        docker run --rm \
                                        -v $(pwd)/mnist.mflow:/root/microflow/model/mnist.mflow \
                                        -v $(pwd)/standard_input.bin:/root/microflow/input.bin \
                                        microflow-pi:pi4
3.what does these command means?---------docker run ... is the command to run the docker image,and the -v is replace the original file in docker
                                        image by outside file.In this command is the model-weight-file:mnist.mflow,and the 
                                        test-file:standard_input.bin.So we can change the test-file and the weights-file by the -v command.
